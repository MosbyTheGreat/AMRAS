# AMRAS
Anti-Mitbewohner-Raketen-Abwehr-System (engl. Anti Roommate Rocket Defence System)

An automated turret, which uses a combination of a Raspberry Pi, a camera, some servos, trafos and methylated spirits
to propel rubber rockets into anyone's face who dares to enter its vicinity.

**NOTE: This is currently WIP**
