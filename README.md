# AMRAS
Anti-Mitbewohner-Raketen-Abwehr-System (engl. Anti Roommate Rocket Defense System)

An automated turret, which uses a combination of a Raspberry Pi, a camera, some servos, trafos and methylated spirits
to propell "rockets" into anyones face who dares to enter it's vicinity.

Credit to Adrian Rosebrock, PhD, from pyimagesearch.com for this wonderful tutorial, which my face tracking code is based on.

NOTE: This is currently WIP with major parts still missing from the repository.

NOTE2: Project is put on hold, until I get new parts. I trashed my camera module.
